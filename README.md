==============
The project now uses yeoman.io and Angular.js.

To get started with the project you'll need to install yeoman.io which you can find out how to do [here](http://yeoman.io/gettingstarted.html).

Alternatively you can do as follows to setup (after cloning):
* Globally install yo/grunt/bower: `npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower`
* Install node_modules: `npm install`
* Install packages: `bower install`
* *  Note: This should br run through a shell that has the git command.
* Install Ruby: `sudo apt-get install ruby` for Ubuntu and http://rubyinstaller.org/ for Windows.
* Install Compass: `gem update --system && gem install compass`
* Run test server: `grunt server`
* *  Note: If `bower install` is giving git errors 127 or 128, try `bower install -f` to dump the cache before install.
